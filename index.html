	This process usually requires the use of a 'key', which provides the information on how to encrypt or decrypt the message.
	<br><br>	
	&emsp;&emsp;The use of ciphers can be dated back at least 4000 years to the Ancient Egyptians. Ideas have been advanced throughout history by various individuals, and by the late 1700's, Thomas Jefferson created one of the first cipher machines, a device know as the Jefferson Disc, or the Bazeries Cylinder.
	<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;This was made up of 36 removeable discs each with its own randomly ordered alphabet. Each disc is given a unique number, and they can be stacked in any order desired. Subsequently the order of the assigned numbers becomes the cipher key. Once a message was set, another row would become the ciphertext and the message was sent, and could only be decrypted if the reciever also has the key.
	<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The 1800's saw further work with the 'Wheatstone Disc' which consisted of two concentric wheels both containing the 26 letters of the alphabet. It incorperated gears to generate ciphertext by turning the inner disc until until the required letter was in the correct position.
	<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps the most well known machine cipher was invented at the end of the first World War; the Enigma Rotor Machine, used famously during the second World War to encrypt German communications. It was an electro-mechanical machine made from a series of discs, interconnected in such a way to provide character substitution with a continuously varying alphabet.</p>

	<div id="classical_ciphers"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Here is a basic example to break down how ciphers work using simple alphabetic substitution, with a key of +2 - simply substituting the letter for another 2 places along the alphabetic scale:
	<br>
	<br>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X W Z

	<br>Modern cryptographic algorithms utilize the (relatively) super fast processors of modern computers to encrypt data and as such are impossible to crack by hand - indeed the modern desktop PC could easily crack any 'classical' ciphers (historic ciphers which are generally no longer used). Nonetheless, they are a good gateway into studying the world of cryptography and as such we shall explore and test a few.
